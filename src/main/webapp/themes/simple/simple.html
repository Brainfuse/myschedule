MySchedule is a web application dashboard for Quartz scheduler.

The Quartz Scheduler is a open source Java library for scheduling services. It has full CRON expression feature and more. The MySchedule webapp will give you a fully working scheduler out of the box that runs on any Servlet container.

There is also a separate experiment Hg repository in here that contains few useful example codes.

quartz-1.8-experiment - A Maven/Java based project that explore Quartz 1.8.x branch. There are many examples and configuration properties files that demonstrate various quartz configuration, such as running with database, RMI, and clustering etc. There is also some scripts runners that starts off demos in command line.

quartz-experiment - A Maven/Java based project that explore Quartz 2.0.x branch. Very similar to above, but using the latest API.

You may get all these by going here http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/source/checkout?repo=experiment.

I have presented Quartz with some sample codes above in Java User Group at Orlando, FL on 5/29/2011. You may see the power point slides here: http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/source/browse/jug-quartz/JUG-QuartzScheduler.pptx?repo=experiment
